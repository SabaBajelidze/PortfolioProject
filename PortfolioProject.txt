in this project i will showcase my skills which include working on data using excel, sql, and power BI.
i will start with very raw data and then make good looking reports using power BI
the data i will be using is called "Behavioral Risk Factor Data: Tobacco Use (2010 And Prior)" from data.gov
basically, this data include information about surveys from 1996 to 2010. 
firstly, lets open the table in excel and try to understand it.
Firstly, we can see that there are columns and rows which we dont need. also, this king of table will be useless for 
power BI as it has every king of information in it. we are going to split this table into 3 or more.
lets transfer the data into microsoft SQL to then start working on it.
i will put explanations as comments in sql queries. go to PortfolioProjectSQL in order to see it.
in microsoft SQL i transformed 1 useless table into 5 smaller useable tables.
Now, i will make little changes using excel.
In excel i added new columns to 4 tables named results and percentage. in results i calculated the percentage on samples to get number of individuals.
 in percentage i divided data_value by 100 to give it type type of percentage
Now, lets transfer this tables into power BI.
In power BI i transformed data deleting data_value column and replacing it with percentage. 
my first report is called tendency of smoking in US.
